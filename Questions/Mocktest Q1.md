# Question1

### Rosé and red wine are produced throughout the sourthern Rhône.

##### a. Name and describe TWO methods of production used for making rosé wines in the SouthernRhône.

+ Method 1:
	+ Direct Pressing (1 mark)

+ Description: ：
	+ Black grapes will be crushed and pressed to extract some colour from the skins
	+ Care must be taken not to press too hard and extract too much tannin
	+ Fermentation takes place off the skins in typically cool fermentation conditions
	+ (1 mark for each valid point above to a maximum of 2 marks)

+ Method 2:
	+ Maceration (1 mark) 

+ Description：
	+ Black grapes are crushed and the skins macerate in the juice
	+ The length of maceration determines how much colour and tannin are extracted from the skins
	+ The maceration may extend into the start of the fermentatione
	+ The juice/fermenting wine will be drained from the skins once the colour level is achieved
	+ Fermentation will continue off the skins in typically cool fermentation conditions
	+ (1 mark for each valid point above to a maximum of 3 marks)

##### b. Much red wine labelled Côtes du Rhône is produced using semi-carbonic maceration. What are the main consideratigns when selecting grapes for semi-carbonic maceration?(2 marks)
+ Only whole bunches selected 
+ Grapes must be fully ripe 
+ Grapes must be free from rot 
+ (1 mark for each valid point above to a maximum of 2 marks)

#####  Describe the process of semi-carbonic maceration. (4 marks)
+ Whole bunches placed in vat
+ The fruit at the bottom of tank is crushed by the weight of the fruit above it 
+ Grapes split and release juices 
+ Ambient yeast ferment the juice at the bottom of tank 
+ CO2 forms and blankets the rest of the fruit in vat
+ The remaining intact berries undergo carbonic maceration
+ (1 mark for each valid point above to a maximum of 4 marks)

##### c. Under the headings below describe the typical style of a newly released, inexpensive red Côtes du Rhône wine produced by semi-carbonic or carbonic maceration. (6 mark)

###### Nose
+ Aroma Characteristics： 
	 Simple, strawberry, cherry, raspberry, kirsch, banana, bubble gum, cinnamone
+ (1 mark for a validdescriptor to a maximum 3 marks)

###### Palate
+ Sweetness: dry 
+ Tannin: low/medium(-) (1 mark) 
+ Body: medium(-)/medium (1 mark)

###### Conclusionse
+ Readiness for drinking and potential for ageing:
	drink now: not suitable for ageing (1 mark)
+ (1 mark for each valid point above to a maximum of 6 marks in total)


##### d. Red wines from the Southern Rhône are often a blend of grape varieties. 
State the stylistic and practical reasons why a winemaker in this region might choose to blend.
+ Stylistic reasons:
	+ Consistency/house style (1 mark)
	+ To provide balance/complexity (1 mark) 
	+ Different grapes offer different characteristics - up to 2 marks for valid comments about how appropriate varieties have complementary components e.g. Syrah adds colour & tannin; Grenache adds red fruit flavours; Cinsault adds spice, etc.) 

+ Practical reasons:
	+ Historlc practice/AC requlations (e.d. many varleties permitted) (1 mark) 
	+ Efficiency i.e. use all grapes at one's disposall/that are pianted (1 mark) 
	+ Vintage variation/certain varieties suited to certain weather conditions (1 mark) 
	+ (1 mark for each valid point above to a maximum of 6 marks in total)
