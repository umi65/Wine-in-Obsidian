# Part1 Pinot Noir
### a. Pinot Noir is best grown in cool and moderate climates. Why is this? 黑比諾最適合種植在涼爽到溫和的氣候，原因為何？
+ Pinot Noir is early ripening (1 mark) 黑比諾是早熟的品種。
+ In hot climates it can become jammy and unattractive (1 mark)

### b. The two regions stated below can grow Pinot Noir successfully. For each region, identify TWO natural factors and explain how they moderate the climate. 以下的雨個產區都可以成功的種植黑比諾。請對這兩個產區，各自列出兩個自然因素並解釋它們是如何的調節氣候。
##### Los Carneros
| Natural Factor (maximum 2 marks) | Explanation (maximum 4 marks) |
|:---:|:--- |
| Fogs (1 mark) 晨霧 | Fog will keep vineyards cooler in the morning(1 mark) by blocking the sun(1 mark). Fog will blanket the vineyards(1 mark)so they are slower to warm up(1 mark) |
| Breezes (1 mark） 午後涼風 | Breezes will cool vineyards in the afternoon (1mark) to moderate the hot afternoon temperatures in vineyard (1 mark) |

(Award marks as indicated above to a maximum of 6 marks in total. Markers should use their discretion to award marks for other valid factors and explanations not listed above)

##### Central Otago
| Natural Factor (maximum 2 marks) | Explanation (maximum 4 marks) |
|:---:|:--- |
|  Diurnal range (1 mark) | A large diurnal range provides cool temperatures at night(1 mark) and slows down the warming of the vineyard in the day(1 mark)  |
|  Altitude (1 mark)  |  Higher altitude vineyards are cooler(1 mark) and will have lower day and night time temperatures(1 mark) |
|  Southern latitude (1 mark) |  The most southerly wine-making region in New Zealand, it is furthest away from the equator(1 mark) giving longer days during the growing season (1 mark)|

(Award marks as indicated above to a maximum of 6 marks in total. Markers should use their discretion to award marks for other valld factors and explanations not listed above)

# Part2 Semillon is a grape that is used in the Hunter Valley to produce distinctive wines.
### a. identify ONE human influence in the vineyard and ONE human influence in the winery which contribute to the distinctive characteristics of Hunter Valley Semillon. Explain how they do so. (6 marks)

##### Vineyard influence：(maximum 3 marks)
+ Grapes picked early (1 mark)) 
+ Retains high levels of natural acidity making the wine refreshing (up to 2 marks)
+ Retains high levels of natural acidity to aid long ageing in bottle (up to 2 marks)
+ Neutral green fruit and citrus character from early-picked grapes (up to 2 marks)
##### Winery influence：(maximum 3 marks)
+ Inert vessel used for fermentation/post-fermentation storage (1 mark)
+ Contact with oxygen kept to a minimum (1 mark)
+ Extended ageing in bottle (1 mark)
+ Inert vessels retain neutral fruit character (up to 2 marks)
+ Protection from oxygen prevents oxidised characteristics developing (up to 2 marks)
+ Bottle ageing contributes to flavours of honey and toast often found in these wines (up to 2 marks)

# Part 3. Chardonnay is widely grown throughout California
#### a. Explain why the producer of an outstanding quality Chardonnay from Russian River Valley AVA might choose to use malolactic fermentation.
+ It can enhance the quality of a wine, by
+ softening and reducing acidity
+ the creation of buttery flavours
+ giving a round, creamy mouthfeel
+ improving microbiological stability.
+ It also suits the relatively neutral fruit profile of Chardonnay
(Award 1 mark for each valid point to a maximum of 5 marks in total)
