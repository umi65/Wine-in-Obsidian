### [[Napa County]]
+ [[Napa Valley]] AVA runs north to south for about
so kilometres, but is only about 5 kilometres wide. It
has the most expensive vineyard land and some of the
most prestigious wineries of California. To the west, the
Wayacamas Mountains form the boundary with Sonoma
County. On its eastern side, the Vaca Mountains separate
the Napa Valley from the northern part of the Central
Valley. Vineyards are found on both the valley floor and
on each valley side and are divided into a number of
smaller AVAs.
The county is subject to a number of cooling
influences, providing a diverse range of climates and
leading to the production of a range of different wine
styles.
The most significant influences are the morning fogs
and cool afternoon breezes from San Pablo Bay (the
northern extension of the San Francisco Bay) that
moderate the temperatures of the vineyards to the
south of the valley. Los Carneros AVA is the most
southerly vineyard area on the valley floor and extends
into Sonoma County. It is cool enough to be a source
of high-quality Pinot Noir and Chardonnay, which are
used to make still wines as well as traditional method
sparkling wines. Moving north along the valley floor
the climate becomes warm enough to ripen Cabernet
Sauvignon and the AVAs of Stags Leap District,
Yountville, Oakville and Rutherford are all principally
renowned for making premium wines from this grape.
With the least influence from the San Pablo Bay,
Rutherford is the warmest during the day, and its red
wines are often considered to have the most power
and structure. Merlot is also widely planted throughout
these AVAs, and Chardonnay and Sauvignon Blanc are
